Developed at the University of Northern Philippines for use in the Miss CCIT (College of Communication and Information Technology) Pageant and the University wide Miss UNP Pageant.  Allows any number of judges to enter their scores for varying rounds throughout the pageant.  Upon completing each round, and ultimately the pageant, PDF reports can be generated and printed.  The reports have lines for the judges to sign indicating that their scores are accurate.  This ensures a complete paper trail of the final pageant results.
